I will be doing clustering analysis of the customers of an e-Commerce. The aim of clustering is to acsretain if observations (in this case, e-Commerce customers) fall into relatively distinctive groups, with the aim of segmenting them into such groups, on  the basis of their various characteristics (In this case, purchasing patterns, amount spent on purchase, personality, choice of purchase, et al). 

The objective is for the store to cut costs on promotions, adverts, et al, by targeting their resources on the right customer segments each time they need to make advert or run promotions, as against targeting all customers, since specific products are only suitable for certain customers.
