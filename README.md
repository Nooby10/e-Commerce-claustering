I will be doing a clustering analysis of an online e-Commerce customers. The aim of clustering is to segment observations (in this case, e-Commerce customers) into different groups, on  the basis of their various characteristics.(In this case, purchasing patterns, amount spent on purchase, personality, choice of purchase, et al). The objective is for the store to cut costs on promotions, adverts, et al, by targeting their resources on the right customer segment each time they need to make advert or run promotions, as against targeting all customers, since specific products are only suitable for certain customers.
